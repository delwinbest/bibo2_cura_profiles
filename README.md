# BIBO2 Ultimaker Cura 3D Print Profiles
My personal collection BIBO2 Ultimaker Cura 3D Print Profiles - use these at your own risk. I take no responsibility for any damage as a result of use.  

## Profile Usage Instructions
There are two tpyes of profiles in this repo, each in their own folder, namely:
    a. printer - BIBO Printer Profiles. One for when printing with BOTH extruders (DUAL), or single extruder prints (E1 and E2). 
    b. print_profile - Profile for different types of prints, namely, PLA, ABS, WOOD, Prototyping, Moving parts and so on. 

1. Install Ultimaker Cura on your computer. The details are here:
https://ultimaker.com/en/resources/51943-installation-ultimaker-cura
Do not open Ultimaker Cura after installation. If you open Ultimaker Cura for the first time, you will be asked to select the 3D printer before you have installed the printe profiles. 
2. Download or clone the print profiles repo. Be sure that the commit you are working against has a tag which matches your version of Cura. For example, I'm curently using Cure 4.2.1, heance I download: https://github.com/delwinbest/bibo2_cura_profiles/tree/cura_4.2.1
3. Ensure Ultimaker Cura is closed, then
    a. Windows Users: 
        Copy files in 'printer' folder to "\Program Files\ Ultimaker Cura XX.XX.XX\resources\definitions"
    b. OSX/MAC Users: 
        Right click on your Ultimaker Cura application file, and choose "Show Package Contents". 
        Copy files in 'print_profile' folder to "Contents/Resources/resources/definitions"
4. Open Ultimaker Cura, then add a new printer through menu (Preferences-Printers-Add). You'll see the BIBO2 printers listed under the Other category. Add the BIBO2 printers one by one.
